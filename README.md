This program calculates the length and route of a TSP tour.

The program accepts problem instances as text files on the command line.

Each line of the input file defines a city with an identifier, the x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate separated by white space

To execute:

chmod +x main.py

python main.py inputfilename

The output file will be inputfilename.tour

The first line will be the length of the tour.

The next lines will be the city identifiers in the order they are visited by the tour.
